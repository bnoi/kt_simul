[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/bnoi/kt_simul.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/bnoi/kt_simul)

Python model of chromosome mouvements during mitosis in Fission Yeast.

This python module provides the simulation of mitotic spindle elements, during cell division.

The underlying model is fully described in:

The 1D version has been used to describe chromosome congression in the following article : [Mary, H., Fouchard, J., Gay, G., Reyes, C., Gauthier, T., Gruget, C., Pecreaux, J., Tournier, S. and Gachet, Y. (2015). Fission yeast kinesin-8 controls chromosome congression independently of oscillations. J. Cell Sci](http://jcs.biologists.org/content/128/20/3720)

The original version in 1D is available in the git branch `simu_1D`. The main branch `master` uses a new geometry system to simulate chromosomes in 3D.

Some code example and documentation con be found here : http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/bnoi/kt_simul/tree/master/doc/notebooks/.

Mathematical documentation about the 1D model is available at [doc/simu_spindle_1d.pdf](doc/simu_spindle_1d.pdf).

## Installation

The best way to install the dependencies is to use the [Anaconda Python distribution](https://www.continuum.io/downloads). Then use the following command lines :

```bash
conda config --add channels conda-forge
conda install numpy scipy pandas matplotlib
```

To install the `kt_simul` model, do :

```bash
pip install -e git+https://github.com/bnoi/kt_simul.git#egg=master
```
